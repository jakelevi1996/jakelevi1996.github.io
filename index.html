    <img src="img/me.jpg" alt="Hi there" style="margin-bottom: 50px;">

    <p>It is I, The Great Jake Levi.</p>

    <p>I'm a PhD student supervised by <a href="https://mvdw.uk/research-overview/">Professor Mark van der Wilk</a> in the <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>. What do I research? Great question. My research objectives are centred around machine learning <em>efficiency</em>. I'm not interested in learning algorithms that require <a href="https://x.com/ylecun/status/1727727093671145978">20,000 human-years of data</a>, <a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/HAI_AI-Index-Report-2024_Chapter1.pdf#page=36.99">hundreds of millions of dollars</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17805#page=127.08">significant environmental cost</a> for each training run (and still get fooled by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10800">obvious tricks</a>). I want to design <em>efficient</em> learning algorithms. How am I going to do that? I have a few projects on the go and will say more about them soon. Stay tuned.</p>

    <h2>ADHD</h2>

    <p>In July 2024 I found out I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder">ADHD</a>. ADHD has affected me significantly at some times in my life, and less so at other times. I am most productive when I have the freedom to pursue what I am most passionate about, in the way that works best for me. I'm sure this is true for everyone to an extent, but relatively I can struggle much more when I don't have that freedom. I'm also frequently late (which really bothers me), and sometimes struggle with deadlines (for example, staying up all night before a presentation in order to finish making the slides, even though I was planning to make them a week in advance).</p>

    <p>But there are advantages of having ADHD. For example, in order to complete tasks that other people find easy, I often have to find a different way of doing things that works for me. This is often slower/more difficult in the short-term, but can put me at a <em>huge</em> advantage in the long-term (a bit like <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Weighted_Clothing">training with a weight vest</a>). The dependence of my productivity on my interests also <em>forces</em> me into positions where I <em>am</em> pursuing my interests (at the expense of a higher salary and/or an easier life), so I don't waste time that could otherwise be spent pursuing my interests. I love doing a PhD because I have a lot of freedom to pursue the ideas I am most passionate about, and to think differently.</p>

    <p>A while ago I wrote an analogy about ADHD, cars, and steering wheels. You can read that analogy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jakelevi1996_5-months-ago-i-found-out-i-have-adhd-its-activity-7271144231832899584--DG0">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Personal</h2>

    <p>Besides rock climbing (trad & sport & bouldering), cinema, and playing classical guitar, my major passion is designing extremely complicated HTML websites. If you would like me to design your website, email me at<br>&lt;a href="mailto:example@email.com"&gt;<a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">ERROR! BROKEN LINK</a>&lt;/a&gt;.</p>
