    <h1><a href="#">ADHD</a></h1>

    <p><em>What ADHD means to me &#183; Jake Levi &#183; 2025-02-09 &#183; [ <a href="/">Back to home</a> ]</em></p>

    <p><em>This blog post was originally a section on the home page of my website, that first appeared on 2025-02-09. On 2025-10-21, after making my <a href="/blog/2025/10/21/">first official blog post</a>, I decided to convert this into a blog post as well.</em></p>

    <p>In July 2024 I found out I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder">ADHD</a>. ADHD has affected me significantly at some times in my life, and less so at other times. I am typically orders-of-magnitude more productive when I'm doing the work I want to be doing, compared with when I'm doing what I've been told to do/know I should be doing but don't find interesting. I'm also frequently late (not because I don't care - it actually really bothers me), spend a lot of time <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">yak shaving</a>, and sometimes struggle with deadlines (for example, staying up all night before a presentation in order to finish making the slides, even though I was planning to make them a week in advance).</p>

    <p>But there are advantages of having ADHD. For example, in order to complete tasks that other people find easy, I often have to find a different way of doing things that works for me. This is often slower/more difficult in the short-term, but can put me at a big advantage in the long-term (a bit like <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Weighted_Clothing">training with a weight vest</a> and then removing it). The dependence of my productivity on my interests also <em>forces</em> me into positions where I <em>am</em> pursuing my interests, which often seems to be <em>opposed</em> to my short-term incentives (a nice salary, an easy life) and <em>aligned</em> with my long-term incentives (not wasting my time pursuing anything that doesn't interest me). I love doing a PhD because I have a lot of freedom to pursue the ideas I am most passionate about, and to think differently.</p>

    <p>In machine learning terminology, ADHD for me is a bit like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)">regularisation</a>. It sometimes nudges me away from easy short-term solutions, and (hopefully) guides me towards "better" long-term solutions. But sometimes the road can be bumpy.</p>

    <p>A while ago I wrote an analogy about ADHD, cars, and steering wheels. You can read that analogy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jakelevi1996_5-months-ago-i-found-out-i-have-adhd-its-activity-7271144231832899584--DG0">here</a>.</p>
